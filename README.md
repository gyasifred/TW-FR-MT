## Overview

Twi-French Machine Translation is a repository dedicated to bridging the language gap between Twi (spoken in Ghana) and French. The project aims to create robust machine translation systems for cross-cultural interaction and practical applications.

## Features

- **Fine-Tuning Script**: Use `fine_tune_opus.py` to fine-tune pre-trained OPUS-MT models for Twi-French translation.
- **Translation Scripts**: Perform translations with scripts like `opus_direct_translate.py` and `opus_pivot_translate.py`.
- **Google Translate API Integration**: Translate via Google Translate API using scripts such as `googleAPIdirect_translate.py`.
- **Evaluation Scripts**: Assess translation quality with metrics like BLEU, SacreBLEU, and TER using scripts like `get_bleu.py`.
