they're able students .
i'm not going to talk about that .
does it hurt ?

he's just an amateur .
i ran into aku at the party last week .
you are my best friend .
i still have some feelings for her .
i don't think you're heartless .
a dollar is a dollar .
she appears to have been rich .
kwabena said it was ok .
which do you like better, the giants or the dragons ?

it's an intriguing theory, but i don't see how it can be tested .
come back for another business
i think it's unlikely that the next model will be any better than this one .
asamoah just wanted to be left alone .
i don't think he'll be able to do that work .
young woman

what did asamoah do then ?
do you want to go on a picnic with me ?
at what hour was she born ?
i'm beginning to understand why you don't bother to try to explain things to asamoah .

she came back in about thirty minutes .
i ran into your brother on the street .
he is full of energy .
i'm really worried .

i'm sure that he's happy .
asamoah and aba detest each other .

here is the house where he lived .
this car is mine .
i'm going to show you something .
i do not know how to use it .
this is asamoah .
asamoah has a terrible headache because he drank too much last night .
that went well .
where did you procure the information ?
take your time
i'm not willing to do that for you .
asamoah suggested to esi that she offer john a cup of coffee .
i decided to come to japan last year .
asamoah will have an answer for you by next week .

that's what i want to hear .
ottawa is the capital of canada .

once a month, she has lunch with her father .
he didn't like to ask for help even if he was starving .
i am going to swim a lot this summer .
it was very cold .
i'm friends with him .
hurry up, please .
i enjoyed reading about your dreams .
it's a double whammy .
this is the dictionary i told you about yesterday .
just leave it to me .
i put my fingers in my ears to block out the terrible sounds .
the lake is big .
kwaku doesn't want to answer abena's message .
he is at home today .
strangely enough, he failed .
let's switch to french .

i thought kwaku needed help .
kwaku is seeking a job .
you're a good father .
what will be the fare
i can't get rid of it .

i agree that's a possibility .
i went to college for four years and all i got was this lousy diploma .

i'm still trying to find out what we should do .
who was with you ?
what were you doing when i called this morning ?
kwabena had a good teacher .
kwabena is their leader .
you don't have the guts .
i wish i could sing like you do .
asamoah drank a cup of coffee .
we know that asamoah is here .
i want to study abroad next year .

i don't want this day to end .
a strange man came up to us .
what's more important to you ?
listen carefully .
this picture reminds me of when i was a student .
it took them a month to move to their new office .
bangkok is the capital of thailand .
she suggested that i should clean the bathroom .
we're broke .
unemployment is rising .
although it was raining, i had to go out .
you're still involved .
i'm sorry . that's really all i remember .
unfortunately, you cannot bring him along .
my father asked me to open the door .
they seem surprised .
i saw nothing at all .
he wants more .
he goes to bed at eight o'clock .
do you see the raccoon ?
appiah and abena bought a handmade rug .
she's your typical workaholic .
asamoah has trouble keeping up with the rest of the class .
that would be cool .
we were held up for two hours on account of an accident .
she gave him something hot to drink .
has he written the letter yet ?
i would like to marry somebody like her .
you'd make a lovely couple .
asamoah always wears sunglasses and a trench coat .
they will fall in love with each other .
kwabena won an award .
will you marry me ?
he parked his car in front of the building .
i don't agree .
the fire spread rapidly .
is paris far away ?
we had lunch at a little coffee shop .
i don't blame you for the accident . it wasn't your fault .
my father and i go fishing once in a while .
who did this first ?
i can't find the address of my hotel .
she wrote to him to tell him that she couldn't come to visit next summer .
kwabena threatened to kill abena .
please cash this check .
we heard shots in the distance .
these horses are asamoah's .
kwabena didn't have the courage to admit his mistake .
he devoted his life to his study .
he wasn't even there .
don't come into my room without knocking .

she asked him for help .
i make lunch every day .
where's the boss ?
do you want to know what's wrong ?
are you certain about this ?
would you like a beer ?
i don't know what i'll do .
asamoah hit abena under the table .
compared to yours, my car is small .
lets go for a taxi
don't you realize what you've done ?
the bus is slow .
each employee is entitled to a two week paid vacation per year .
he's good .
long skirts are in fashion .
i don't want to be seen in his company .
we received a large package .
rest in peace .
you seem resourceful .
just give it time .
you'll all get used to the cold climate in no time .
she divorced him .
i managed to catch the last train .
one language is not enough .
is kwaku a genius ?
he is now in a very difficult situation .
what train you are going to take ?
australia is no exception .
i am confident he will keep his promise .
you seem to have a crush on asamoah .
do you have a better idea ?
we watched him until he was out of sight .
not knowing what to do, i called her .
where do you want me to put this ?
what is the purpose of your visit ?
john said to them
i tried to in vain to deal with the problem .
how did you find it ?
kwabena told me that you like to eat spicy food .
he doesn't have enough money to buy a car .
asamoah was speechless .
kwaku wanted to send a message .
i need a moment of your time .
i've cut myself .
there are many parks in our town .

i need to know your intentions .
no matter where you go, i'll follow you .
i'm not going to play golf with asamoah .
this won't happen again .
we love it .
asamoah was very sleepy .
he had to pay his own debts .
he looks as if he could not even harm a fly .
i like you .
can you still remember where we first met ?
i used to have one, but it was stolen .
that doesn't answer my question .
i often have bad dreams .
is it true that you are going to paris ?
you're going to love this book .
i don't know whether to cry or to laugh .
the air is damp .
i didn't buy them .
rules are rules .

don't be stupid .
life is getting hard these days .
i wonder if anybody knows where asamoah is .
kwabena began to like abena more and more .
she turned down our proposal .
there are many problems to solve .
asamoah managed a small bar near boston for quite a few years .
he was in a hurry to see his mother .

the scenery is really splendid .
she bowed to me politely .
do you have shoes and socks ?
it is difficult for me to get up before six .
