You may use my pencil if you like.
This is a fundamental question.
I'm sure Asamoah will complain.
I have a great deal to do today.
Asamoah didn't want to get out of bed.
Will you watch the Olympics?
France was at war with Russia.
Our boss approved our plan.
That university was my first choice.
You can't be a doctor.
His house was small and old.
I think it is a mere coincidence.
Asamoah probably knows the answer.
He will come back when he gets hungry.
Can you help me a little?
I was defenseless.
The two of them fought for the prize.
I guess I've gotten lazy.
I made the woman angry.
My father is an expert surgeon.
He can play baseball.
She lost her way.
It's unlikely that anything serious will happen.
The dish is too sweet for Asamoah.
It is impossible for me to finish the work in an hour.
Boston is my home.
In times like this, there's nothing like a hair of the dog.
He's now on the phone.
Have you ever been to that village?
The fugitive made a run for the border.
Nobody noticed her absence.
The food was finger-licking good.
Shall we begin now?
Nothing can force me to give it up.
He speaks Chinese fluently.

Do you know anything about Australia?

Asamoah's explanation was too complex.
You should acknowledge your failure.
Compared to yours, my car is small.
He has no objection to our leaving.
We're ready to go.
He was fired for stealing.
His teeth are yellow from smoking too much.
It's not enough.
I think it's time for me to buy my daughter a decent computer.
Have I changed that much?
Were you playing tennis yesterday morning?
Asamoah helps me in French.
Would you like a dog?
I know Asamoah did it.
Do you believe in ghosts?
Asamoah finally got hold of the rare stamp he wanted.
I read the letter to him.
Do you know what it says?
Asamoah had a stroke.
I do not like mathematics very much.
Which came first, the chicken or the egg?
She has been dyeing her hair black for years.
I thanked him from the bottom of my heart.
He will be very busy next month.
What kind of clothes should I pack?
It was still there.
Your ideas are a little old-fashioned.
Unlike my brother, I cannot swim.
I'm learning a lot.
It's not as hard as you think.
I went to the zoo.
At that altitude the weather can change rapidly without warning.
He had an unpleasant screechy voice.
I am not Czech.
I often wrote to her when I was a student.
He thinks he is somebody, but really he is nobody.
He was afraid about what was going to happen.
Whatever you may say, you won't be believed.
A rabbit has long ears and a short tail.
The birds were hungry.
He promised he would tell us.
Did you finish the job?
Asamoah doesn't want to eat lunch now.
Everyone but Asamoah was there.
That was the source of his troubles.
Asamoah didn't tell Abena everything.
Do you know how to do this?
My husband really likes to do exercise.
He said it didn't matter whether we stayed or left.
Are you still thinking about applying to Harvard?
Leave it off the list.
Do you have a boyfriend?
You had better be ready in case he comes.
I'm old.
This is why he got angry with you.
Nothing can happen to you.
I don't want to be up all night.
Please don't hurt me.
I have a little money now.
I haven't felt that way since Abena left.
You'll get there by three o'clock.
We're watching.
Asamoah did just that.
I had the boy carry my bag.
Your speech was appropriate for the occasion.
I wish you had told me the truth.
What else do you want me to read?
She showed her guests how to eat what she had prepared.
It hardly ever rains in the area.
My father doesn't drink liquor.
The FBI was called in.
Four soldiers and twelve civilians were killed.
She suggested that I should clean the bathroom.
I thought you were injured.
This idea is not rational.
Could you open the window?
I don't know the reason why he went there.
May I invite you to dinner?
That gradually became his habit.
I remember the event as clearly as if it had happened just yesterday.
Asamoah will have an answer for you by next week.

Chinese is not too difficult to learn.
I'm not scared.
It is about ten minutes' walk to the station.

I live in Turkey.
Playing the piano is her favorite pastime.
Let's do it when he comes.
We played poker the entire day.
Asamoah and Abena aren't my parents.
What's more important to you?
You have made all my dreams come true.
Let's meet again soon.
They have come.
Have you ever been to Australia?
You should not go alone.
It is something my mother made.
Let's get together again next year.
Please let me go home.
I know all their names.
She looked at several dresses and decided on the most expensive one.
I never expected to meet her in a place like this.
Who are these people?
I'm looking forward to visiting your country this winter.
Can you teach me French?
It's probably OK.
Sit up straight.
Go back home.
Neither of them seemed old.
You weren't elected.
I found a bird whose wing was severely damaged.
I didn't want you to know.
This little girl let the birds escape.
Is the work hard?
The farm production of this year is better than we expected.
The road was icy.
They were lying on the grass.
I've cut myself.
It's a good idea.

I don't want to give up.
Our education system needs to be seriously revamped.
You should stay.
Do not interrupt when another is speaking.
Asamoah wants to be hugged.
Is that why you won't help Asamoah?
Father bought me a new bicycle.
How many hours did you spend with Asamoah?
That doesn't seem too difficult.
I studied for a while this morning.
Keep smiling.
Why did you do it?
He spoke too quickly for the students.
They were scattered in all directions.
I'll never forgive Asamoah.
Belgium is not as large as France.
I'm going because I want to.
All this is new to me.
He can swim.
Asamoah is obsessed with learning French.
This will do nicely.
I don't like him coming to my house so often.
She likes to dress in an old-fashioned way.
The time has passed very quickly.
The scenery is really splendid.
You're going to be jealous.
It is preferable that he gets there by tomorrow.
He secretly showed me her photo.
I don't know whether to cry or to laugh.
I'm looking for another job.
The computer is a relatively recent invention.
What time did Asamoah get here?
I have no reason to lie to you.
Where's Asamoah sleeping?
Do you know much about Asamoah?
I had to make a choice.
I need to go eat something.
I really should leave.
I've been looking for you.
Asamoah wrote to Abena about John.
I hope you'll make up your mind quickly.
I don't have a lot of money, but I get along somehow.
Don't you want to know?
We've run out of tea.
I've already seen that movie.
If I knew how to use a computer, maybe they would pay me more.
Life is very short.
You could have done it.
Nobody knows how I feel.
Human cruelty has no limits.
What's your relation with him?
I nearly got hit by a truck today.
He came home three hours after that.
Can you give me a lift to the station?
I can't remember what I ate last night.
I'm always under stress.
He's a liar.
She used to drink beer.
I hate taking risks.
I already know how to drive.
Did you choose an interesting book for your son?
I never for a moment imagined that I'd be able to meet so many famous people.
I don't think I've broken any laws.
He had known some of them before the war.
I do not know how to use it.
He will not come today.
Who was in the car?
I'm no rebel.
That's why he lost his job.
I think you're lying.
There's no more salt.
I should tell Asamoah everything.
Asamoah knows who they are.
I have already written a letter.
Come at once.
I'd like something to drink.
She told him all about her adventure.
I'll let you know as soon as I get there.
He has two dogs.
We hurried to catch the bus.
How long have you been learning English?
Maybe my grandchild will be the first person to set foot on Mars.
I have an account at that book shop.
Take a breath.
Perhaps it will rain in the afternoon.
Asamoah and Abena have decided to break up.
My sister showers every morning.
It was nothing but a joke.
She doesn't speak to me.
I know you like coffee.
I hope things will turn out well for you.
The picture is hanging on the wall.
I've lost my umbrella. I must buy a new one.
I know this must be difficult for you.
If you keep fish in a fish bowl, you should change the water at least once a week.
It never occurred to me that my words would hurt her feelings.
You can't say no.
They thanked God.
We must cut down our expenses.
I wish you had not told him about the plan.
I read this article yesterday.
Abena used to play with dolls.
Asamoah did his best to find a reason to stay.
Asamoah thought he would be late.
There's a serious split in the party.
We can meet.
I'd think twice about this.
What's your theory?
A lot of people are dealing with hay fever now.
I think this is his umbrella.
This is very serious.
Are you free on Wednesday?
What newspaper do you subscribe to?
Why do you want this?
We won't be able to do it without your help.
Taste this wine to see if you like it.
Asamoah can speak neither French nor Spanish.
They say that he will never return.
There's a traitor among us.
These questions are easy to answer.
I am ashamed of my son's conduct.
I leave in an hour.
This song is easy to learn.
He kept me waiting.
This is the last train, sir.
Has he gone already?
One after another the animals died.
I am not eating.
I wonder if anybody knows where Asamoah is.
You can't smoke during work hours.
It was a really beautiful day.
Would you please come over here?
Asamoah was very sleepy.
You have no heart.
I'm glad you were there.
Asamoah heard that Abena and John had split up.
Hand me my mug.
Where did you get all that money from?
Asamoah has kept his promise.
I have hunger pangs.
She'd never been so frightened.
I know it's true.
I forgot I was in Australia.
Look up words you don't know in your dictionary.
I accidentally threw an expensive knife into the trash.
Australia is a beautiful country.
I had hoped we might become friends.
I love watching baseball.
The brandy is all gone.
Do you live here?
What do you want me to ask Asamoah?
What do you want to do in the afternoon?
I'm not a teacher and don't want to become one.
Ask her what she bought.
It is not necessary for us to attend the meeting.
They went on talking all night.
I can't believe you're giving up.
There are too many commercials on TV.
I don't like it, either.
She went shopping with him last Monday.
The missing cat has not been found yet.
When was the last time you switched on this machine?
He went fishing in the river.
I like meat better than fish.
Who's responsible for this problem?
Bring me today's paper, please.
This is broken.
Do you live in Tokyo?
The captain was the last person to leave the sinking ship.
Don't you want to kiss me?
There's not much traffic on this road after 8:00 p.m.
No one was watching.
I've heard this before.
They were extremely excited.
What's the nationality of that cameraman over there?
I wasn't conscious of anyone watching me.
There's no beer here.
How tired are you?
The car is ready.
I didn't look.
Asamoah wants to move here.
You remember what happened last time, don't you?
He is French.
I have looked for it up and down.
We heard somebody shout.
He is doing well.
I clean up my room every Sunday.
You and your friends are invited.
He left the room the moment he saw me.
I have lived here for years.
I saw him first.
Don't you realize what you've done?
Water, forests, and minerals are important natural resources.
You must be careful in choosing your friends.
I don't know where that street leads.
I thought he was coming.
You know what you have to do.
We have a moral responsibility to act.
She left before I got home.
I help my mother with the housework every day.
The situation seemed very tense and dangerous.
I have a feeling today is going to be interesting.
He came running.
It is up to you to finish the task.
No one knows the answer.
Fill this out.
Are you a Japanese citizen?
You're making a big mistake here.
You don't speak French, do you?
Be sure to pick up some milk.
Imagine yourself to be on the moon.
He makes mistakes every time he speaks English.
I don't blame you for the accident. It wasn't your fault.
Broccoli is one of the healthiest vegetables.
It's a delicate problem.
You have to do it.
He never stopped writing.
I made him open the door.
You're weak.
I've brought lunch.
What sort of play is it?
I didn't sleep all night.
Am I going to die?
There is a rumor that gold has been found in the valley.
He got through his work.
Do you know any doctors who speak Japanese?
The child ran into the house.
He is too smart not to know it.
Fortunately, I was on time.
You have nothing to fear but fear itself.
I'm free now.
Nothing out of the ordinary happened.
How many cats does Asamoah have?
I promise I'll do that before the end of the month.
If you trust such a fellow, you'll lose everything you have.
I don't want to bother Asamoah while he's working.
I don't want to start rumors.
I play volleyball often.
He thinks he knows everything.
He became famous.
The town has changed a great deal since then.
Which subject do you like the most?
People said that he is insane.
He could not speak clearly.
Who wrote the Bible?
You'd better relax a bit.
Tears rolled down her cheeks.
I seldom speak to him.
I never heard anything like that.
Kwaku seemed a bit angry.
I can not put up with his insults any longer.
Kwaku knew he'd be punished.
Kwaku is nibbling on a carrot stick.
I never got caught.
She is one of my friends.
The number of college students is increasing.
We must consider what to do next.
Can I keep one of your pictures?
I can't take my eyes off her.
How was your walk?
Her name is Abena.
The food is getting cold.
I'm engaged.
I'm just finishing up some homework.
Which browser are you using?
Kwaku found the note that Abena had left for him.
That is not true.
She believes that he is innocent.
The company rewarded him with promotion.
You can't swim.
The tape recorder was lying on the table.
It rarely snows in this area.
We deliberated whether we should cancel the reservation.
What do you expect to happen?
I would like to marry somebody like her.
This street used to have another name.
The wind is blowing from the east.
These shoes have lasted one year.
This is the book that you are looking for, isn't it?
My head hurts.
I'll be there all day.
Smoking is forbidden in this area.
Kwaku goes to Bible study on Sunday mornings.
She ran across her old friend while walking in the park.
Has the world gone mad?
Kwaku's house was destroyed by a hurricane.
My father bought this house for us when we got married.
Your bicycle is much newer than mine.
Is it this hot every day?
He smells like a goat.
Shut up and don't say a thing.
I feel like going out rather than staying at home today.
Might I ask you a personal question?
I'm anxious to see you.
Add a few more names to the list.
I wonder if this is love.
May I ask a favor of you?
I don't mind if it's hot.
She rides her bike to school.
They're just students.
He smiles every time I see him.
I would like to hear your voice, too.
I know we don't really know each other all that well.
I leave this afternoon.
I feel like taking a bath now.
Who wants to go next?
I see you remember me.
The picture is in black and white.
Kwaku tried to talk Abena into driving all night.
The orphan met up with his two sisters when he was five years old.
I don't have enough money yet.
We should set a trap.
I found the cage empty.
He saw her and blushed.
What time do you go to the market?
Thank you for the present you gave my son.
Kwaku answered my question.
If your visa expires, you must leave China.
Kwaku told Abena that he was happy.
You're a nobody.
I know you better than you think.
Something is terribly wrong.
She didn't give me her name.
A smile is the most beautiful curve on a woman's body.
It was black.
I'd be devastated.
He stopped smoking.
I want to get to the bank before it closes.
There isn't any milk in the glass.
I want something sweet.
I need a paper bag to put it in.
I need a moment of your time.
She was asked to convince him to paint the house.
Go and wake Abena up.
Get that book for me.
Some people actually collect rocks.
Kwaku felt like crying.
He's a man we can trust.
I can't keep my eyes open.
I am eating fruit.
Delete that picture.
I'll pick Kwaku up.
Don't talk in the reading room.
It's like a dream.
I agree completely.
You make me laugh.
Where's Kwaku's office?
Don't tell lies.
Did that accident really happen last year?
I want to travel by airplane.
No Canadians were injured.
Kwaku and Abena never see each other nowadays.
Did you have to share a bedroom with your brothers or sisters?
He is always boasting of his achievements.
You are my best friend.
Kwaku didn't expect that Abena would be able to play the harp so well.
There's one more item to discuss.
I thought Kwaku would agree with me.
I'm a prisoner.
It went well.
Kwaku is at school.
Let's not waste any more time.
She lacks experience, doesn't she?
Kwaku was so excited.
She has a large office in this building.
You need not worry about her.
Kwaku doesn't have to stay home to help Abena.
Kwaku is deeply grateful for all Abena's help.
I just want to help.
They didn't change their minds.
I'm looking forward to seeing your father.
We've all been there.
Kwaku believes in God.
She used to go to the museum on Sundays.
Kwaku hopes that it'll be fine tomorrow.
Los Angeles is the second largest city in the United States.
There is milk all over the kitchen floor because my wife broke the bottle.
We had lunch at noon.
I hear his business is on the verge of ruin.
Kwaku made fun of Abena.
That doesn't worry me at all.
He has started acting strangely.
It's amazing how much he can stand.
I want to do that as often as I can.
Kwaku has been teaching us French for the past four years.
Who are you talking with?
He might not be happy.
I have nothing to do at the moment.
What changes the world is communication, not information.
There are many factors.
Today I came to work by car.
I hear that he's still alive.
Are the stores closed on Sunday in England?
I just don't understand why people would want to live here.
Kwaku didn't think that would ever happen.
The teacher read a passage from the Bible to the class.
Doctors use medical equipment.
Do you recognize these?
Kwaku always seems to be smiling.
Don't let him watch this film.
Life begins when we realize who we really are.
Christmas is approaching.
We believe in the existence of God.
Kwaku was unable to concentrate.
He made a speech in English at the meeting.
Keep your hands clean.
Today is Monday, so I'll do what I always do on Monday.
He gave a detailed description of the accident.
Do you know any French?
Unfortunately, my father isn't at home.
I was asked to fix the bicycle.
Abena has two boyfriends.
This isn't Australia.
Abena said that she loved me, but I didn't believe her.
How about we meet tomorrow?
The policeman asked people to back off.
She devoted her life to helping the handicapped.
He makes good use of his talents.
The big dog frightened the baby.
We simply want you to leave.
I'm going to give it one more try.
Why didn't you help me?
I'll take my dog out for a walk.
Everyone else waited.
I never for a moment imagined that I would win.
Once a month, she has lunch with her father.
I got the information from him directly.
Kwaku is always late.
I'm a childhood friend of Kwaku's.
I'm not interested in doing that now.
Can I bring someone?
It's about five miles.
They asked for an increase of salary.
People who drink alcoholic beverages are not allowed to enter.
I am uncomfortable in these new shoes.
They serve excellent food here.
Kwaku saw Abena and John flirting with each other.
Lead us, since you know the road.
Nod your head if you understand.
We had a wonderful holiday.
Kwaku walked Abena to the gate.
Different people have different ideas.
He taught me how to swim.
The flood ruined the crops.
Why aren't they worried?
I'm neutral.
The market opens at 9:00 a.m.
Do you love each other very much?
My explanation may sound strange.
Kwaku seems to be unreliable.
Kwaku lit his cigar.
What a beautiful dress!
Kwaku drives.
Are you in trouble?
Although Kwaku is sick, he's swimming again today.
Please remind me to go to the doctor's tomorrow.
I couldn't breathe.
I was concerned.
The world's largest zoo is in Berlin, Germany.
Do you like to travel?
The company is managed by my older brother.
Kwaku has done it before.
It's a pity you don't know how to dance.
My father has never been sick in his life.
Sign here.
By the age of 25, she had lived in five different countries.
How does she do it?
Where did you procure the information?
Nobody saw anything.
He had a strange dream.
Japan's population is larger than that of Britain and France put together.
We are all praying for Japan.
She can sing very well.
I feel hungry.
They are considered the greatest rock band in history.
He made an apology.
He exhausted his money.
She stayed there for several days.
It is necessary for you to go there.
I'm going to hurt you.
Don't be afraid to ask questions.
He parked his car in front of the building.
I can easily convince you of his innocence.
Kwaku doesn't know anything.
When was the last time you kissed your wife?
I want to eat ice cream.
Do you want to sit down?
He told me that he was going to Italy.
He is afraid of the dog.
Kwaku told me why he didn't like Abena.
I don't know, nor do I care.
What Kwaku really wanted was for Abena to be happy.
I am sure I met him somewhere, but I do not remember who he is.
Something has happened to the engine.
We'd better go.
I didn't know it was there.
What are we having for supper?
What do you grow on your farm?
I've already told you all I know about that.
Every time I go to see him, he is in bed.
You're the one who knows how to do this, right?
Where did you take your boots off?
Who painted this painting?
I tried to in vain to deal with the problem.
I'm afraid I have no choice.
Most of the students here go to school on bike.
Kwaku's health has been deteriorating for some time.
You want to see a French movie, right?
She returned to Japan.
There was a lot of food in the house.
Have you been paying attention?
You can't sit with me.
Kwaku should be congratulated.
Get everyone inside.
You are welcome to do anything you like.
Kwaku says that he has changed his ways.
I like the teacher.
They have wine.
Many drivers abandoned their cars in the snow.
Please fix that.
I like trains.
Everyone knows everyone.
We must start immediately.
We suddenly realized what was happening.
I was just wondering if I could borrow three hundred dollars from you. I can pay you back next Monday.
I'm glad to be invited to dinner.
When did you see her?
Abena is a beautiful woman.
When did you go home?
Kwaku read the letter aloud.
I think we'll make it if we hurry.
Kwaku was immediately worried.
Kwaku has a Canadian wife.
How much money do you think Kwaku makes?
Kwaku wants us to follow him.
Kwaku threatened us.
Abena and Kwaku care about privacy.
Lake Titicaca, the biggest lake in South America, is in Peru.
Kwaku was playing in the backyard.
America is a country of immigrants.
I hear from him once a month.
What a shock!
We need more time.
Does she have children?
Water boils at one hundred degrees.
I hear footsteps outside.
Pay close attention to what I tell you.
There is a post office in front of the station.
The teacher handles his pupils well.
I hate precooked food.
If you can't beat them, join them.
We can't find Kwaku.
I like watching movies in French.
Kwaku is growing up.
Kwaku can't have gone far.
Kwaku asked Abena about the traffic accident she was involved in when she was five years old.
I can't follow you.
They will agree on that.
Who is in the house?
He was very patient.
I'm afraid we'll lose the game.
Kwaku is too poor to hire a lawyer.
Does she speak English?
I haven't seen anything of her lately.
My parents met each other in the mountains.
This book is old.
This copy is full of mistakes.
You could count to ten when you were two.
I know that this is important for us all.
Kwaku is hypocritical.
Anything will do.
I can't believe that didn't work.
Don't judge a man by the clothes he wears.
That man is a soldier.
I got sunburned.
We'll go after we eat.
Do you have two books?
I can't work for you anymore.
Kwaku invited Abena out to lunch.
I'm warning you not to do it again.
I wish I wouldn't have to meet you again.
I have a return ticket to Osaka.
Oxygen from the air dissolves in water.
Kwaku was born in Boston.
You really must stop smoking.
Abena thinks martial arts are silly.
Kwaku called me yesterday at nine in the morning.
Is she Japanese?
When I got the phone call telling me of my father's death, I was completely flustered.
Take a little nap on the couch.
Can you give an exact report of what happened?
Kwaku fainted.
Kwaku, Abena, John and Alice are friends. They've known each other since they were children.
The baby has been crying for a long time.
I was speechless with emotion.
I do it every Sunday morning.
You drive too fast.
How much is this dress?
I've heard enough.
The vaccination left a funny little mark on my arm.
She heard him scream.
I usually have breakfast at seven.
He was seen to come out of the house.
Kwaku will become a good soccer player some day.
Don't ask.
What a beautiful girl she is.
What time should I wake you up?
I have been to Paris.
Everybody loves him.
The prawn cocktail was delicious.
I want to go talk to Kwaku.
Kwaku can speak French.
Your manners aren't very good.
He's very angry.
He often comes late to school.
Not every bird can sing.
These are my friends.
I'm more afraid of Kwaku than I am of Abena.
We're home.
Even the hard-hearted can be moved to tears.
I'm very close to Kwaku.
I'm going to call Kwaku right now.
The law has been changed.
He had a talent for painting.
Cheer up! Everything will soon be all right.
All you have to do is to wait for me to return.
I'm not going to talk about that.
What's happening in there?
I looked the word up in the dictionary.
We must warn him.
She dried her face on a towel.
Let me read the paper when you have finished with it.
I'm surprised at you.
In fact, he loves her.
Please keep me updated.
Luckily, he won the game.
Who's your favorite hockey player?
Do you require a deposit?
I'm a beginner, too.
Kwaku is singing.
Thank you for being my friend.
What did Kwaku do here?
The fact is that I can't swim.
Kwaku admitted that he always has trouble remembering names.
We must pay attention to the fact that no nation claimed sovereignty over this region.
Kwaku is quite good at cooking.
But what will you do if he doesn't come?
It is a good habit to look up new words in a dictionary.
Are there a lot of Moroccans in Germany?
Sometimes they say, "I can't go to school today. I'll go tomorrow."
Has something happened?
I found out where she was.
They arrested her.
He's used to speaking in public.
Kwaku keeps a diary.
She embroidered her own initials on the white handkerchief.
I really want to figure this out.
He's as strong as a horse.
Do snakes bother you?
She is as bright as any in her class.
I didn't know that Kwaku couldn't speak French at all.
You sound mad.
The more we learn, the more we realize how little we know.
How can I manage to finish on time?
I left Kwaku behind.
I thought Kwaku would say that.
You're going to do exactly as I tell you.
I cannot drive a bus.
Weren't you at home?
I don't like him very much. To tell you the truth, I hate him.
This is a little gift for you.
Do you drink beer or wine?
If you want to, we'll go.
Do you still love Kwaku?
I've never noticed that.
I ordered a pizza.
He is precisely the one you are looking for.
Kwaku smiled approvingly.
What else did Kwaku say?
Are there still some empty seats?
Put it onto the table.
How did you end up in Boston?
Who was with you?
I hear that even taxi drivers often get lost in Tokyo.
We need to clean the car.
You can't enter the building without a permit.
Did you go to London that day?
Kwaku is married to a teacher.
Only four horses competed in the race.
These books aren't just for children.
Kwaku forgot where he put his glasses.
I know it well enough.
There used to be a bridge here.
I'm honored to be here.
This one is special.
The scissors are not sharp.
The bus left early.
It's the biggest building in the city.
I thought Kwaku was your brother.
I usually go to bed at ten.
We would like to stay here tonight.
Keep away from that.
I have a lot of plans for the future.
I wasn't supposed to tell you that.
Are you badly hurt?
What will you wear?
She went to the museum by cab.
You're the only person I know that doesn't like bananas.
It's going nicely!
It's normal to make mistakes.
Please give me a glass of milk.
I didn't realize the difference between them.
He went away without saying a word.
Isn't that your shirt?
She was in the hospital for six weeks because of her illness.
Is this really spaghetti?
If you could go back in time, what would you change?
Is it very far from here?
He drank beer.
I wanted your opinion.
Don't ask them where they are going.
Let's get together and talk it over.
I know your mother.
Cash or credit card?
Kwaku is hunting for a job.
I paid for the purchase in cash.
I think it's important to tell the truth.
Since he's busy, he can't meet you.
Kwaku thinks about Abena all the time.
I spent last Sunday relaxing at home.
It will snow tomorrow.
She bought him a camera.
Kwaku is making good progress.
Kwaku doesn't have any classes today.
Kwaku stabbed Abena with a hunting knife.
I cannot understand what happened.
Ignore Kwaku.
We didn't want to worry you.
You can't count on Kwaku's help.
Where is your cap?
It was a difficult game.
My dog has a wonderful life.
I was a member of the soccer club when I was in junior high.
He is not as intelligent as his brother.
They were amazing.
He's not stupid.
Kwaku asked Abena what kind of movies she liked.
Can you answer that?
He may have said so.
I can't see anything because the whole place is dark.
We are young.
German cars are very popular.
Three hours is too short for us to discuss that matter.
How are you doing?
The list is limitless.
Were you in America last month?
I wish I were a millionaire.
Someone must've left the door open.
Where can I wash my hands before I eat?
This is hers.
I don't know her at all.
I was afraid I'd be late.
Why don't you want to eat lunch with us?
Don't believe anything they say.
You can't go against the laws of nature.
I forgot to turn off the television before going to sleep.
She tried not to cry.
Do you want me to call a doctor?
All of the students were present.
You've got to be kidding me!
Will you eat a little cake?
Kwaku was expecting you fifteen minutes ago.
I see the problem.
He won't like this.
Does Kwaku have what it takes?
I just got the news.
It's no secret.
Do you want a drink?
You might not find it.
I'd be honored.
I've been alone on this island for three years.
May I use this telephone? "Go ahead."
You're Kwaku's boss, aren't you?
I've seen him before.
He looked after the baby.
I don't think Kwaku will want to go with us.
This hospital has a lot of new equipment.
I'm already twenty and I have no idea what I want to do with my life.
He came from the south.
I need you to show me what you have in your bag.
It's just your imagination.
It was fun to watch you guys dancing.
I will come earlier next time.
He is in college.
I'm very anxious about my son's safety.
I'm here.
This is the best.
He went to London, where he stayed for a week.
Your O's look like A's.
The bus doesn't always come on time.
Red is better.
What can go wrong?
I didn't know that you knew Kwaku.
I don't want anyone to play my guitar.
Those who live in glass houses should not throw stones.
Kwaku is Abena's grandfather.
Kwaku should've told Abena.
Are you in there?
May I ask a few questions?
He referred to your illness.
I almost did it.
She intends to play tennis this afternoon with her father.
What I do is my problem.
I'm ashamed because I acted foolishly.
People love freedom.
We heard shots in the distance.
The child threw a stone at the cat.
Where is your room?
To reduce misunderstandings we should learn the techniques for communicating successfully.
I saw that film, but it wasn't very good.
Come and see us sometime.
How many eggs does this hen lay each week?

Kwaku's in there.
She lives in this neighborhood.
I need to get one.
Your hair will grow back.
Kwaku said that he thought Abena understood.
He got caught.
Kwaku turned off the computer.
President Truman had to make a difficult decision.
Kwaku didn't know how to read music.
My advice is for you to go home.
Only a few students understood the matter.
I have a great life.
Please tell me you're OK.
This hat isn't new.
I am going to swim a lot this summer.
Let's go back to the beginning.
This is so annoying.
I want to drink a cup of tea.
The door opens into the bedroom.
We want to have a word with Kwaku.
I'd like to see them again.
We didn't have much trouble.
Who buried the gold bars here?
Kwaku couldn't find the page he was looking for.
I won't go back with you.
I was eating when you called me.
No one lived on the island at that time.
The police blamed the accident on the taxi driver.
The prospects for Japan's future look dismal.
The price of meat dropped.
You must not lose sight of your goal in life.
I missed you.
Kwaku told Abena the absolute truth.
Do you have something for me?
Kwaku appreciated Abena's support.
Where can I buy envelopes?
Kwaku wished he had someone to talk to.
Do you really think that that would work?
When was the last time you visited your grandmother?
Is that your house?
Kwaku is trying on shoes.
I borrowed money from my father.
Let's not invite Kwaku.
I'll look it up.
The jewel was stolen during the night.
If you were to win the lottery, what would you buy with the money?
Could you repeat that, please?
Do you think I should go alone?
I remember this story.
Everything was ready for the trip.
Do you have a map of Boston?
I can't buy this because I don't have enough money.
I think we're ready.
They got married last fall.
You should carry out your duty.
My mother is busy cooking supper.
Kwaku is poor.
Kwaku wants to marry me.
Don't underestimate the problem.
Where did you take your jeans off?
We used to take a walk before breakfast.
She is an expert in mathematics.
India was governed by Great Britain for many years.
Raise your hand if you have a question.
When the police arrived, the thieves had disappeared.
My opinion has changed.
He was so tired that he couldn't walk.
Kwaku said he was terrified of snakes.
He will be waiting for you about two o'clock.
That girl is Abena.
I've already tried it.
I wouldn't like to meet him in a dark place.
I like milk more than juice.
Kwaku predicted Abena would win the race.
I saw a snake eating a mouse.
Can you write your name here?
His success depends on his efforts.
He married a farmer's daughter.
She is helping him.
I was absent from the meeting.
I'm not going to send Kwaku a Christmas card.
He is a teacher.
You're probably wrong.
I don't quite understand what you are saying.
Marriage is a dinner that begins with dessert.
Please give me another chance.
We can pay.
Please eat. You're hungry, aren't you?
It's a large amount.
Someone is watching you.
Papa made sure all the lights were turned off before going to bed.
They advertised that they had a house for sale.
I was told that you know Kwaku's telephone number.
That doesn't make any sense.
She translated it word for word.
I told you that I didn't want a party.
I think it's unlikely that the next model will be any better than this one.
We surrendered.
How old is the Eiffel Tower?
Is Kwaku a genius?
This book belongs to Kwaku.
Kwaku might be able to shed some light on this.
What time shall I come?
It's your choice.
An old man spoke to me suddenly.
Seicho Matumoto died in 1992.
I think watching TV is a waste of time.
The men are eating lunch.
I went to the hotel by cab.
Kwaku certainly looks intelligent.
I started this topic.
If you mix blue and red, the result is purple.
Americans eat a lot of meat.
His whole family is like that.
This orange is delicious.
Kwaku can't stay.
He is twice as heavy as his wife.
I can speak Chinese.
What a wonderful gift!
Is it true that you cleaned the house by yourself?
He goes there now and again.
You're the best thing that ever happened to me.
I didn't tell anyone what time I'd be arriving.
The dog ran away from us.
Could you tell me how to get to your office?
She received the maximum sentence of ten years.
This is the fish he caught.
Tell me your version of the events.
That coin is counterfeit.
Kwaku knew he was in trouble.
Why do you know that?
I don't want to do this, but you leave me no choice.
I don't know what to do from now on.
I never expected Kwaku to get out of prison.
He talks fast.
I didn't buy them.
Everyone wants what they can't have.
Kwaku deserves to be promoted.
There is a bus on the street.
Kwaku asked Abena for some money so he could buy something to eat.
Everybody paid.
This is totally unacceptable.
She called the students into the room.
They just arrived at their destination.
Don't tell me you're tired already.
Finish your work quickly.
They'll be OK.
The pain went away because I took the pills.
Read the book aloud.
They were very happy.
Do exactly what we tell you.
Each employee is entitled to a two week paid vacation per year.
I just saw a shooting star.
He said we must keep the secret.
Don't go near the fire.
This meat smells bad.
Kwaku said he knew you.
I don't think anyone could have stopped Kwaku.
Kwaku paid the bill.
Immediately after the bell rang the teacher came into the classroom.
Share it with us.
I need you to take a look at this.
Which drinks don't you like?
I want to make sure nothing will happen to Kwaku.
Why didn't you tell me?
That hurts.
Kwaku seemed to have his mind on something else.
This flower is yellow, but all the others are blue.
Kwaku and Abena eat lunch together every day.
Cool off!
Today is not my day.
You saved my life.
I want you to listen to what Kwaku has to say.
I'm delighted to be here.
The matter we're discussing is interesting.
I know what it was.
He lives outside the city.
I feel a little uncomfortable bringing this up, but I love you.
Where's the entrance?
What did Kwaku know?
He kept reading a book.
Only a handful of people came to the meeting.
I want you to meet my new friend, Kwaku.
I think I've met you before.
All you have to do is wait.
We've known each other a long time.
Are you on some sort of medication?
Kwaku and Abena are flying to Boston tomorrow.
It is possible that you have already read this book.
We're in love.
We need an ambulance.
Kwaku was the last person I expected to see there.
The police searched that house to be sure the stolen shoes were not there.
People who live in glass houses shouldn't throw stones.
I hardly know anything about Australia.
I go to school every day.
I hope you have fun.
It'll have to be done forcibly.
If you were on the ball, this wouldn’t have happened.
She was there in the morning.
The sum of two plus three plus four is nine.
She is already back.
I don't want to do it again.
His plan is dangerous!
Did you come here by train or by bus?
No animal can exist without plants.
Get out of my office.
He became very dangerous.
I'd like to stay for one night.
Soft music is often conducive to sleep.
He brought me coffee, when I had asked for tea.
I am talking with Kwaku.
My mother is seriously ill.
You like her, don't you?
Kwaku says he can't imagine life without Abena.
Kwaku knows what's happening.
Why do you study English every day?
You made me laugh
You are no longer a mere child.
Do you have any idea where Kwaku put the keys?
I understand it.
This is my house.
We don't like our neighbors, and they don't like us, either.
Only six people came to the party.
The fire started in the bathhouse.
You take everything too literally.
Kwaku saw Abena sitting alone on a park bench.
Kwaku begged Abena not to say anything to his parents.
The size of the universe is unimaginable.
Are you sure you can do this?
Eat and drink as much as you want.
I'm just having fun.
Kwaku has to meet Abena in the park tomorrow at 2:30.
We'll be happy.
This is the video I wanted to see.
They made us work all day.
Both men opposed the war in Vietnam.
The meeting ended earlier than usual.
He likes being surrounded by young people.
I'm not from this world.
There's no place like home.
She's a beauty.
Why did she ask for our help?
Everything happened too quickly.
Don't work so much.
You have a beautiful family.
Humans were never meant to live forever.
Kwaku could see he wasn't going to win the argument.
I don't remember what I need to do.
Kwaku loves sunsets.
Kwaku didn't come to the last meeting.
Watch your language.
Every afternoon, the woman went to church to pray.
Kwaku couldn't find anyone for the job.
That person died.
The choice is yours.
They rejected my proposal.
Kwaku isn't looking for a relationship.
If you harm her in any way, I'll kill you.
I need you here.
How embarrassing!
How am I even going to buy this?
What the newspapers say is true.
Kwaku arrived at the hotel.
Kwaku continued working.
This account is correct.
Please don't leave me alone.
They're looking for it.
We'll be leaving tomorrow.
I love fish.
My grandpa drinks coffee with a group of old guys every morning.
You speak too much.
The bus was full.
Kwaku knows he has to help Abena tomorrow.
We've all done it.
I'll call back as soon as I can.
He's not a bad person.
Kwaku couldn't find Abena's house.
He denied everything.
Do you want to go to the zoo?
I saw a flock of sheep.
We're in no hurry.
Observe all warnings, precautions and instructions.
If you had told me the truth, I would not be angry now.
That is my mom's computer.
She seems to have known the secret.
I feel like I've become someone else.
I'd like to see her again.
Kwaku's boss is Canadian.
Forgive us.
He is not the sort of person who likes to listen to jazz.
Kwaku will come back. I'm sure he will.
The witch cast a spell on the naughty boy.
I make lunch every day.
I would like to travel alone.
Wait here till he comes back.
His brother is more patient than he is.
It snowed.
They are talking about music.
I think that watching TV is a waste of time.
Kwaku was accused of doing sloppy work.
Let me go and buy some bread.
Children should drink milk every day.
What's the problem, Kwaku?
I like foreign languages.
Kwaku is sending a fax.
Kwaku hasn't done anything to be ashamed of.
Kwaku made no attempt to convince Abena that he was innocent.
The patient may pass away at any moment.
There's something here.
I wish I had brought an umbrella.
Kwaku is a little younger than your daughter.
Kwaku reluctantly went to the dentist.
When does the rainy season in Japan begin?
He admitted that he wanted to escape from here.
I'm really surprised you got the prize.
Kwaku ate.
The water flows under the bridge.
He no longer lives here.
I don't think this is the best time for us to talk.
Since I will see him tomorrow, I can give him a message if you want.
We had to stop.
I will wait until you have finished your homework.
I'll mail this questionnaire as soon as I finish.
Have you met Kwaku yet?
Kwaku ate at a new restaurant the other day, but he doesn't remember the restaurant's name.
In Australia, they speak English.
Let's switch to French.
I made that.
Do you know how to dance?
I would like you to sing a song.
She wants to drink some warm milk.
The language of that tribe is as complex as any other human language.
He can imitate the rest of the family.
The soldier acted bravely.
We're from Boston.
She said that she was happy.
I can't get rid of it.
Drink something.
I'm studying French.
My father does not like the heat of summer.
They chatted over coffee for more than two hours.
I will get up early tomorrow.
It's dangerous to play with fire.
Nobody saw me.
Maybe Kwaku didn't hear you.
Several delegates disagreed.
Why are you so insecure?
You should have completed it long ago.
They crossed the Atlantic Ocean.
I invited my friends to dinner.
I'm not fat.
I wasn't writing anything.
I couldn't catch what he said.
Why do I need a lawyer?
I saw her clean the room.
I was made to open my briefcase.
I think that we should try again.
They all talked.
Today is a holiday.
The thief was bound hand and foot.
Kwaku doesn't want to answer Abena's message.
I think the pay is enough.
Do you have a better idea?
She didn't write either.
Make me happy.
I did that which she asked me to do.
He lied to my face.
I thought Kwaku would want it back.
It is up to me to tell the sad news to her.
Kwaku left on Monday.
If I have time, I'll do it.
We went for a walk.
I think we are in agreement.
All our effort ended in failure.
Kwaku is moving back in with us.
I have to help Abena.
I wanted you to know how I feel.
The profits were very high.
Please make sure that your seat belt is securely fastened.
An innocent man was arrested by mistake.
You might want to talk to Kwaku.
Very few people live to be 100.
My girlfriend is Canadian.
Kwaku died.
Would they do that?
He was arrested for drunken driving.
I'm very busy.
Kwaku needs a good lawyer.
If you change your mind, let me know.
He waited for the elevator to come down.
Her name is known to everyone.
I knew Kwaku very well.
What would you like to do today?
I thought Abena still loved me.

God is always right.
Can your brother drive a car?

Do you want to eat something before we leave?
You guys don't think they'd beat Kwaku up, do you?
They carried out the plan right away.
Computers are complex machines.
We went to Boston by car.
It was a tragedy.
The chairs are made of wood.
I hardly ever speak French nowadays.
She did it on purpose.
I love it!
It's incredibly boring.
He drinks coffee before work.
She left her son alone in the car.
Did you find what you were looking for?
A bunch of people were standing outside waiting.
These books are very old.
What's happened, has happened. It's history.
I have to go on a diet.
I apparently made a few mistakes.
If you want to get out of here alive, follow me.
I came here to make you an offer.
Can I borrow this umbrella?
This is a new model.
A strange man came up to us.
I think she is charming and attractive.
I think he likes you.
I will give you back the CD in a week.
I've been looking for them for more than one hour.
We can't let this continue.
I'll find someone else.
Kwaku's passport has been confiscated.
I worked in this factory.

She had a happy childhood.
I'm seeing Kwaku again on Monday.
The man fell down on the ground.
Do you like this design?
He ran off with his best friend's wife and hasn't been heard from since.
You didn't tell him anything?
He won the lottery.
Open your mouth!
You haven't changed much.
He knows how to make women cry.
I just had a little chat with Kwaku.
Mother went shopping at the department store.
I started writing a book.
I just can't get used to this.
Let's walk a little faster.
Will he succeed or fail?
The chances that that happens are minimal.
You don't need to write more than 400 words.
You are from Hokkaido, aren't you?
Why did you bring your ukulele?
He had a good look at the papers.
Close your eyes.
That's a fake.
The boy I saw searching through the garbage can said that he had not eaten anything for four days.
Kwaku has an imaginary friend.
We are digging a well in the backyard.
Obviously that's different for men and women.
He is an ill-mannered man.
The only useful answers are those that raise new questions.
I beg you.
I will go when they come back here.
I prefer coffee with milk.
I'd like to have a test for breast cancer.
What's your favorite hotel in Boston?
I'm going to stay in the pool a little longer.
I'm trying to convince Kwaku to do that.
Picasso painted this picture in 1950.
He is sure of success.
Japanese flags were flying.
Take it to Kwaku.

Can you drive?
I need it ASAP.
Kwaku said he's feeling fine.

You're the tallest one.
Generally, Americans love coffee.
I would have liked to come with you, but I didn't have time.
I've been a teacher for two years.
I will gladly help you.
Kwaku has no money.
After his wife died, he lived for quite a few more years.
It is still too early.
He caught them stealing apples.
Seen from a distance, the big rock looks like an old castle.
Kwaku had no idea what to say.
She has plenty of books.
She doesn't have any enemies.
I can't tell you where Kwaku lives.
They say she is the kindest woman on earth.
Kwaku signed the contract without reading it.
You should put your ideas in writing.
She looked as though she had seen me somewhere before.
I'm relieved to hear that.
Would you like to talk to a lawyer?
I knew you were alive.
A true friend would've helped me.
We have not yet discussed which method is better.
I never expected to meet her in a place like that.
I warned Kwaku.
Kwaku is a thief.
Do you like chocolate milk?
Her face turned white.
No one voted against it.
This room is pleasant to work in.
We all have flaws.
I hope it helps.
Kwaku was better.
She is afraid of her own shadow.

Kwaku left the TV on all night.
Kwaku doesn't like to eat fish.
None of us are busy right now.
Australia is no exception.
I've already eaten.
Keep in mind what I tell you.
Kwaku just stood there watching Abena staring at herself in the mirror.
You've always helped me.
I'm tired of listening to his boasts.
I love this store.
What would you do without me?
We agreed among ourselves.
My hobby is making model planes.
Even the air smelled different.
We can't help you unless you help us.
All the roads leading into the city are full of cars.
Kwaku is seeking a job.
We haven't got much time.
My brother did.
I slipped and twisted my ankle.
She's Canadian.
What more can a girl ask for?
Was there a book on the desk a moment ago?
It can't be that he is busy.
What do you have against those people?
I can't stay much longer.
Really?
Kwaku said that he doesn't know where Abena lives.
I didn't know you had children.
They were busy.
Kwaku's diet is deficient in protein.
You'll be safe here.
He's good.
I am interested in sports.
You can always ask a question in return.
That company is managed by a foreigner.
She wrote to him to tell him that she loved him.
I want you to work for me.
I'm only telling you what I heard.
That's an excellent wine.
Kwaku bought a car last week.
The thief reluctantly admitted his guilt.
What he told me yesterday is a white lie.

Please tell me how to get to the beach.
He's rich and powerful.
We can do that.
Your friend left town.
Have you ever lied to your mother?
She took the book back to the library.
How do you think I feel?
They didn't budge.
I haven't been able to get enough sleep lately.

I need to know when to come.
They're hiding.
That dog has a short tail.
I wouldn't have worried about that.
Come in and sit down.
Do you want to eat something?

Are you pleased with your new house?
She tried to persuade him not to decline the offer.
I did nothing unlawful.
He is good at singing.
Her father is an excellent pianist.
It's more than enough.
He should come right away!

I'm calling you.
I'll remember this incident forever.
There was an earthquake yesterday.
Has anyone spoken to Asamoah?
Won't you go to the concert with me?
Mom is getting dinner ready.
Few people know how to do it.
I don't want to hurt her.
Did you live here before?
We're in the house.
Asamoah is very competent.
Would you like to order?
Asamoah felt that he deserved an explanation.
When was the last time you saw Asamoah wear a tie?
A priest skillfully drew a picture of a priest on a folding screen.
Do you see the raccoon?
He gave me some bread, also some milk.
The phone rang when I was having lunch.
We're studying physical science.
I wouldn't do that if I were you.
We took her straight to the clinic as soon as she fainted.
Asamoah ignored the suggestion.
A teacher's salary is less than an attorney's.
They were all here.
It's time for you to get up.
To tell the truth, I don't like his way of thinking.
I'd rather take the bus.
I sent her a doll.
I like to travel.
For some reason, people have been avoiding me like the plague ever since I got back from India.
I saw him caught by the police.
I have to wash my hands and brush my teeth.
There is no wind today.
There's no need to get so angry.
The others paid no attention to her warning.
Does that make you happy?
I knew Asamoah was married.
I'm going to Paris next month.
I give you my word.
I was never so humiliated in my life.
He had the nerve to say that.
Asamoah pointed to one of the pictures and said, "Who's that?"
The bank is closed.
I am 19 years old.
Somebody is lying here.
Asamoah asked Esi if dinner was ready.
I'm afraid of owls.
I had not seen a lion before I was ten years old.
You're just a boy.
He suddenly noticed his wallet was missing.
We're hopeless.
Is Asamoah eating?
The meetings are over.
Asamoah doesn't usually wear a hat.
I know lots of Canadians.
They missed a good chance.
Water evaporates when it is heated.
I saw nothing at all.
I don't know what caused it.
The business was a failure.
He's your typical workaholic.
Cesar Chavez asked that strikers remain non-violent even though farm owners and their supporters sometimes used violence.
That's what Asamoah was looking for.
I have a client waiting in the waiting room.
Who's my teacher?
Don't forget your promise.
Asamoah shouldn't have told Araba.
How did you ever get out of it?
I haven't read either of his novels.
Their company survived the crisis.
Do ants have ears?
How much time did you spend doing research before you started writing?
Asamoah got the job he wanted.
Asamoah is very crafty, isn't he?
No one knows the real reason why we love dogs.
You're welcome to join me if you want.
Maybe you'll succeed.
I carelessly dropped a vase.
I have no money to buy the book with.
Show me that list.
May I escort you home?
We waited until 2:30.
Asamoah has three daughters.
How much is a room?
She didn't know what to say to him.
A stranger is just a friend you haven’t met yet.
Your wish will come true in the near future.
That toy is made out of wood.
He despises people of a lower social class.
Asamoah can't see anything without his glasses.
We're going to have to work together.
Do I look old?
We were the only guests.
Asamoah slept on the bus.
Don't open the present yet.
Kublai Khan is the grandson of Genghis Khan.
I'll study a lot.
I didn't want milk.
Asamoah shouldn't say things like that to Araba.
Asamoah borrowed a book from Araba.
Can you tell me the time?
How were the pyramids built?
Asamoah handed Araba a twenty-dollar bill.
Everyone prayed.
Asamoah had good reason to be angry.
Asamoah asked if anyone had seen Araba.
May we accompany you on your walk?
Please don't walk on the grass.
She is opening the window.
The store is already closed.
It seemed that he was short of money.
Keep an eye on the baby while I am away.
I am familiar with your name.
I want something else to eat.
I'd rather go for a walk than see the movie.
You shouldn't complain.
The water in this river is very clean.
Leave me alone, please.
Why don't you tell me?
He's demented.
You shot Asamoah twice.
I checked into a hotel and went right to sleep.
I know this is difficult.
We're short of money.
Asamoah knows what you did.
She promised to meet him last night, but she never showed up.
His family loved me.
We're easygoing.
I don't feel like exercising.
Give the book to whomever wants it.
That's huge.
I gave it to the little boy.
There is almost no furniture.
Both my brothers are married, but my sisters are all single.
I put my fingers in my ears to block out the terrible sounds.
My father has lived in Nagoya for 30 years.
Haven't you called the police yet?
I wish I could eat steak more often.
They know him.
That is not my line.
I agree that's a possibility.
I don't understand why Asamoah doesn't like me.
I've just finished breakfast.
Asamoah is a picky eater.
I gave Araba chocolate.
Maybe someone else can help us.
I was appalled at the sight.
I'll pay for this.
I missed going out with her and eating at our favorite restaurant.
A lot of people are waiting to see what is going to happen.
Asamoah wasn't very ambitious.
You can't play baseball here.
What do you know about him?
How many symphonies did Beethoven compose?
He showed me around.
Atomic energy can be utilized for peaceful purposes.
No one noticed her absence until the meeting ended.
Everyone wanted to see what Asamoah was doing.
He was really the man we were looking for.
He talks a lot about his father.
I don't understand French at all.
No matter what you do, don't laugh.
I told Asamoah I'm from Boston.
Asamoah wants to quit.
I sold the car.
Do you get the idea?
Will you let me see you again?
This film is worth seeing many times.
Minnesota's state bird is the mosquito.
The Japanese have a lot in common with the Chinese.
I spent the whole day in the park.
This is spaghetti.
His nasty comments fueled the argument.
I thought Asamoah was your best friend.
This is a tropical storm. It'll be over soon.
Asamoah asked me to speak more slowly.
The United States was at war in 1864.
Asamoah crosses this bridge at least once a week.
This book doesn't belong to Asamoah.
I often ski.
Asamoah advised Araba to take better care of herself.
She is expecting a child.
I was looking for a hotel, when I saw you.
I know almost nothing about it.
The iPad would be a perfect solution for me if it could properly display web pages with Flash content.
I stayed at home last night.
I'm going to go wake Asamoah up.
Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.
Visit us tomorrow.
I'm likely going to be fired for doing that.
How do you go to school?
Which one is good?
It isn't mine.
I stayed up late preparing for the examination.
What do you want to do first?
He is proud of his collection.
We didn't discuss it.
I made that one.
Asamoah has lied to you.
Asamoah is indiscreet.
Asamoah doesn't think he did anything wrong.
Who's the greatest composer of all time?
My father will retire at the age of sixty.
Determination is everything.
I received an email from Asamoah this morning.
Try and do it.
The climate affected his health.
Just give me a moment.
Am I interrupting something?
A change of air will do you a lot of good.
Tell me who you saw.
I think he won't accept the proposal.
I just want to hug you.
Kwabena died two years ago in a plane crash.
He kept on writing stories about animals.
You made a wise choice.
What do you say to a beer?
He lives by himself.
His grandfather died of cancer last year.
I have neither time nor money for that.
Kwabena doesn't know what happened to Abena.
That isn't to my liking.
Please pour me a little tea.
Why is my bag empty?
He's too young to understand.
They know something.
Abena keeps her jewels locked up in the bank.
You are saying you intentionally hide your good looks?
Kwabena seems friendlier than before.
It was a casual meeting.
They murdered Kwabena.
Kwabena is upset about this.
Why doesn't that surprise me?
She had a great attachment to that old house.
They won't find you here.
She laughed and gave me a playful shove.
Do you think we should import rice from the U.S.?
Kwabena won three races.
Some of them have committed suicide.
I have a lot of money at my disposal.
Kwabena is very upset about this.
I'm in danger.
Businessmen could not pay back money they owed the banks.
He was angry with his son.
Lincoln is one of the greatest figures in American history.
Kwabena has had enough.
I love sunsets.
You're fired.
They admired the lovely scenery.
I hope you don't mind me dropping by.
If the sun were to rise in the west, I wouldn't change my mind.
What is your favorite animal?
I've just arrived at the airport.
I want to find somewhere I can sit down and relax.
I can prove who the murderer is.
They wanted to win the war quickly and return to normal life.
My uncle never writes letters.
Uranium is used in the production of nuclear power.
Neither joy nor sorrow can last forever.
He listened very carefully in order not to miss a single word.
I can't bear the sight of him.
Where are we going first?
I'll be in Boston.
I think I'll come back soon.
Kwabena and Abena went to Australia for their honeymoon.
She hardly ate anything.
In a word, life is short.
You don't have to do anything you don't want to.
Abena is really great. She cooked a wonderful meal for me and even washed the dishes herself.
I didn't say a word.
Have you seen their new apartment?
He told me to be here at noon.
Kwabena showed Abena how to do it.
The lake is big.
Kwabena turned the music off.
Kwabena heard Abena talking to John.
Sign it at the bottom.
Kwabena has been charged with Abena's murder.
It started as a hobby.
I will go, provided the weather is clear.
I think there's been a misunderstanding.
He is having lunch now.
No matter how long it takes, I will finish the work.
She wears high heels to make herself look taller.
What did you do last weekend?
I slept the rest of the day.
His father is Japanese.
Do you know French?
Kwabena is lying again.
What's he doing there?
I need to have a little chat with Kwabena.
Did anyone see where I left my glasses?
The odor of dirty socks makes me gag.
It'll be impossible to get a visa on short notice.
I'm really not as bad as you think I am.
I'm not going to explain that to you now.
I'm sorry, I forgot your name.
I want you to make the decision.
There is one apple on the desk.
Few roads existed in North America at that time.
I am sure I saw her two years ago.
Don't resort to violence.
How did you come by this money?
Don't look a gift horse in the mouth.
You aren't my mother.
Maybe Kwabena wants to be alone.
The word processor on the desk is my father's.
Kwabena accidentally set fire to the curtain.
I believe it is a genuine Picasso.
We want one.
I just spoke to Kwabena.
There isn't much difference between the two.
Business is slow.
She's lost her car keys.
It was cloudy all day long today.
Is breakfast ready?
He is good at taking photos.
Kwabena went with Abena to Boston.
His dream has finally come true.
Pierce was elected in 1852.
I need a hug.
How did you come by this painting?
We're satisfied.
Kwabena's lack of compassion surprised Abena.
This is a meeting room, not a waiting room.
I didn't see who was driving.
Kwabena wasn't babbling.
My sister is thin, but I'm a little overweight.
It's not OK to smoke here.
Are you still married to Kwabena?
I don't doubt that she is married.
This room will soon heat up.
We have a boxing club in our school.
I just solved the puzzle.
I met him at a club.
Who designed the White House?
Is that likely?
Can I do anything?
Kwabena told Abena that he was going to kill himself, but he didn't have the courage to do it.
My apartment is near here.
Do you have a car?
The dog sniffed the stick.
It's not as bad as it seems.
What do you think of the new teacher?
He likes potato salad.
Don't bring your dog with you.
Did you drop it?
Check this translation with the original.
Where can we park?
Kwabena has lost the will to live.
Nice timing.
Kwabena bought a lottery ticket.
Kwabena believed everything Abena told him.
He said nothing that would make her angry.
She asked me if I knew Kwabena's address.
You may take this book as long as you keep it clean.
He has a bookstore in the center of the city.
What do you like?
He has a drug allergy.
Did you see what she was wearing?
I think that's wrong.
I'd rather stay at home than go fishing.
I have to cook the vegetables.
You must take this medicine, whether you like it or not.
He'll run out of luck sooner or later.

What did you learn?
Kwabena will never live up to his parents' expectations.
Kwabena has no interest in politics.
I don't regret it one bit.
The teacher wants us to divide the work on this project.

What time do we leave?
Babies can become dehydrated from a high fever, so I was told that it would be better to send him to the hospital.
Kwabena is digging a hole.
Kwabena accepted the nomination.
He denies nothing to his children.
Kwabena took off his tie.
Would you mind mailing this letter for me?
Is that your room?
We need evidence.
What's your favorite commercial?
Don't come whining to me.
Kwabena and Abena's custody battle for their children was a long, drawn-out affair.
I admit I'm wrong.
Choose whichever you want.
She pricked herself with a needle while embroidering.
This spoils all my plans.
No one seems to smile anymore.
My parents want me to study medicine.
Coal is not always black.
It's dangerous to jump off a moving train.
I went to the hospital to visit him.
I want to eat something good.
He won the prize last week.
It doesn't work so well because the batteries are running down.
You can come together.
Kwabena felt persecuted.
Do you have a similar saying in Japanese?
The situation is worse than we believed.
I tried to change the subject, but they went on talking about politics.
He's a tennis player.
They work for me.
May I borrow your calculator?
Giving up isn't the answer.
Will you write your name here?
Kwabena attempted to snuggle, but Abena pushed him away.
It rained for a week.
Have fun.
I took off my hat and entered the church.
Iron is hard.
Kwabena hasn't been to the supermarket in a long time.
The letter informed her of his death.
I really wish I could help.
Fruits have seeds in them.
There are lots of things I want to talk about.
We're clean.
Unfortunately, you cannot bring him along.
How bad do I look?
Kwabena is kissing his wife.
Police caught the criminals.
I like puzzles.
She gave him a piece of paper.
Come with me now.
Whose bike is this?
Kwabena couldn't have had anything to do with this.
I have to see Kwabena.
I want to thank you for that.
Kwabena liked horses.
He terrified him.
He just returned from abroad.
Kwabena chose to live in Boston.
I saw Kwabena and Abena while I was waiting for John.
Write me.
We looked for it here and there.
Are you for or against the war?
I'll meet you at the usual place.
Take care not to break the glasses.
What's your favorite boy's name?
Marina read magazines on weekends.
Now that you know the truth, perhaps you'll feel better.
This is a terrible idea.
Do you want me to go with you?
Are you seriously thinking about pursuing a career as a race car driver?
Let's have a drink.
I don't understand what you are trying to say.
Look at that red building.
All our teachers were young and loved teaching.
She advised him to visit that museum.
I think you had better stick to your present job.
Kwabena doesn't know if he will be able to visit us next Monday.
She is going to have a baby this month.
They have nothing in common with the older generation.
She suggested that I go to the store with him.
Take the pan off the fire.
It's impossible that he forgot our meeting.
Did you really say that?
I don't want to miss you.
I'm done with my homework.
Consider me your friend.
I was late to school.
Something's bothering Kwabena.
They said no.
Let's compare this dictionary with that one.
The man went out of his way to take me to the station.
Kwabena is signing documents.
Kwabena couldn't say a word.
Apparently, the murder happened in a locked room.
I received a good job offer.
My mother has good handwriting.
This is the reason why he did it.
Where can I park?
Why did your cats hide under the blanket?
You may be wrong.
Kwabena banged his head on a tree branch.
Will he recover soon? "I hope so."
They took the subway.
Cross the street.
If you go out so lightly dressed, you'll catch a cold.
Is eating meat morally wrong?
They have something in common.
After years of suffering, she finally decided to forget the past and begin a new life.
What's your favorite television program?
He was not conscious of his own mistake.
It is no use arguing with her.
Technology is in itself meaningless unless it serves mankind.
Rest in peace.
I jog before breakfast every morning.
Thanks for the cake.
We must do away with violence.
My father is very good at fishing.
We should appeal to reason instead of resorting to violence.
How arrogant!
Business people exchange cards at the beginning or end of a meeting.
I play with him.
We slept in the same room.
Flags of the world fly proudly at the United Nations headquarters.
I saw her yesterday.
She has a sense of humor.
The computer is in the library.
Don't forget to take your umbrella when you go out.
Somebody should do something.
She doesn't smile for me anymore.
I don't want to go to Kwabena's birthday party.
I still can't dance.
Kwabena insulted Abena.
What she said wasn't true.
Kwabena and Abena have been married for over thirty years.
I like you.
Please wait a bit.
I've spent all the money.
You don't have the guts.
You can call me this afternoon if you want.
We're ready to put the boat in the water.
I hope you have a happy future ahead of you.
I think it's better not to lend him a hand.
Kwabena couldn't answer even one question on yesterday's test.
A study found that almost 10% of men were obese in 2008. That was up from about 5% in 1980.
Return it when you are done.
I'm going to sell my car.
Kwabena refused to budge.
When was the last time you hunted?
Is your father busy? "No, I don't think he is."
I should have listened more carefully.
Kwabena said he didn't want a drink.
Kwabena doesn't want to compromise.
What's on the menu tonight?
Those shoes are old fashioned.
You can't live without water.
She had to study hard to catch up with her classmates.
I fell asleep with my contacts in.
I'm not crazy.
Where did you see them?
Kwabena has no intention of leaving Boston.
The rumor may or may not be true.
I have seen angels and talked with them.
I want to dedicate this song to Kwabena.
Their names were crossed off the list.
Kwabena doesn't know when Abena will be here.
I have to fix the washing machine.
I've been up all night thinking about that.
A computer is an absolute necessity now.
Kwabena is arguing with Abena.
We were held up for two hours on account of an accident.
Would you please have a look at this document?
It's still rising.
Plastic boxes last longer.
I think it's time for me to apologize to her.
She gave them some apples.
Did you read the sign correctly?
This is what I have to do.
Kwabena seems awfully sad, doesn't he?
Kwabena told me that you like to eat spicy food.
There are lots of things I want to talk about.
We're clean.
Unfortunately, you cannot bring him along.

Kwabena seems awfully sad, doesn't he?
Kwabena told me that you like to eat spicy food.
She was seen at a restaurant with her lover.
How do you get your children to eat vegetables?
I don't know what happens here.
Kwabena held Abena close.
I assumed Kwabena had told you I would be here.
I'm really hungry.
If there are problems, call me.
Please let go of me.
I bought a dog for him.
I've dealt with this store for years.
She was advised by him to get more exercise.
Have you already read this book?
Are you afraid of silence?
I realized I couldn't win.
You're a traitor.
Kwabena can take care of himself.
You can't help now. It's too late.
Children love to sing.
Kwabena asked Abena to make him something to eat.
Thanks for helping me.
I told them to send me another ticket.
I owe you ten dollars.
I can't get the car to start.
Kwabena is a fascist.
I want to change jobs.
Kwabena admitted that what Abena said was true.
Hopefully, we'll win.
The accident damaged her car's front wheels.
That must've taken place while I was away.
Have a seat, please.
Kwabena's wife is a teacher.
Here's the magazine you were looking for.
I nearly forgot it.
Did you get robbed?
Your mother is very young.
He wants something cold to drink.
I don't know how to buy a ticket.
That's why I'm here.
Who discovered the island?
This is what you have to do.
Where do you buy vegetables?
Kwabena made himself something to eat.
I know you and Kwabena have had some problems.
Cover the pot while you cook.
Many young people in Spain are unemployed.
Do you want to sit next to the window?
Your sacrifice was not in vain.
I am happy to hear your voice.
That's all I can say at the moment.
I have lost my keys.
Kwabena is famous.
Abena is Kwabena's older sister.
There is an old castle at the foot of the mountain.
I don't know what motivated me to come here.
Kwabena has lots of things to tell Abena.
I don't like artificial flowers.
She is a very good teacher.
Can you come?
Give me a ring tomorrow.
Please put on your shoes.
Her parents loved me.
The water's cold today.
Abena is helping her mother.
Kwabena thought Abena should go over to John's house and help him.
I wish I could figure out how to stop my children from fighting.
I want to know where Kwabena went.
After decades of civil war, order was restored.
I don't want to listen to you.
I used to go to church on Sunday.
Nobody knows where Kwabena went.
Kwabena took Abena out for a drink.
This is not good at all.
He tried it with a friend.
Each one does what he wishes.
I remember my mother teaching me the alphabet.
Please turn off the radio and turn on the TV.
Did you hear the news?
The weather is good.
Is Kwabena really happy?
Now we don't know what to do.
We will play soccer after school.
There are some things that I don't understand.
Get to bed.
He said he was innocent, but all the same we believed he was guilty.
The experiment confirmed his theory.
I wish I could figure out how to burn a DVD.
I'd rather not waste my time trying to learn a language that I don't need to know.
Abena said she would do her homework.
She fled for fear of being caught.
This is by far the most interesting of all his novels.
Everyone's asleep.
We all need to live life to the fullest.
Would you like to eat lunch together?
Who turned off the light?
It looks like Kwabena is winning.
You need a haircut.
I'd like to talk to the foreman.
I think that's what Kwabena did.
We have a crisis.
I'll be out of town for a few days.
I don't want to feel like this anymore.
Kwabena is three months behind in paying his rent.
You don't need to worry about it.
I'd like you to come work for me.
Even plastic surgery won't do anything for your ugliness.
Does that mean we're in trouble?
I won't see her anymore.
How did you spend your summer holiday?
My box is twice as heavy as yours.
Where's your suitcase?
A friend of mine is looking for someone who can speak French.
I am getting dressed.
Don't speak French to me.
I couldn't get in touch with him.
I think she will come back soon.
I'm thinking of buying a house on Park Street.
I know the rules.
Kwabena and Abena have been friends since they were kids.
I have been busy this week.
There aren't any clouds today.
We took him to the hospital right away.
You know me so well.
This is a picture of my mother.
We are thankful for your kindness.
We drove through unfamiliar territory.
Ask Kwabena anything.
She was married to a rich man.
Where's the truck?
The battalion surrendered to the enemy.
Kwabena wanted Abena to clean the bathtub.
Remember what I told you.
Now it's serious.
He thinks that planes are safer than cars.
His heart beated slowly.
Do you think it'll work?
I was married once.
Kwabena looks appalled.
Were you here alone?
Is Kwabena helping Abena?
Was that a yes?
You should know that by now.
They adopted the orphan.
Would you like to play with us?
How many letters are there in the alphabet?
I have my own chores to do.
I can sing.
I'll sleep here.
Both you and I are students.
If you tell the truth, you don't have to remember anything.
I wasn't aware of what was going on.
Everything remains as it was.
I know something you don't.
You were alone at that time, weren't you?
They started at the same time.
She speaks English very fluently.
There were some flowers there.
Where's your money?
I need a good lawyer.
He is reputed the best lawyer in this city.
He does not have any friends.
Have you eaten?
He's a student at this college.
I live in Boston now.
I have no idea what I'm doing here.
After he had done his homework, he went to bed.
The company is trying to improve its image.
Kwabena talked.
I'm quite tired.
Kwabena asked me the same questions Abena had asked me.
This might interest you.
Aren't you too young to smoke?
I took my clothes to be cleaned.
We had a glorious time.
I love learning.
This river becomes shallow at that point.
I found the film interesting.
What's the total population of France?
Excuse me. What's your name?
There were no radios in those days.
The air became warm.
You understand what I mean, don't you?
Do you know what that means?
The climate is mild in this country.
The police have been searching for Kwabena for years.
They live on Third Avenue.
I know it's wrong.
If Kwabena would eat less, he'd be healthier.
That was a valuable experience.
I'm the only one who was able to do that without help.
Where do they live?
They ate up all the cake.
The lady moved here a month ago.
She works as a secretary in an office.
Kwabena mispronounces many words.
You look tired. You ought to rest for an hour or two.
What time does she get up?
We have more apples than we could eat in a day.
I speak a little Spanish.
I recognised him immediately.
The last time we went out to eat, she paid for the dinner.
Are you still studying the Okinawa dialect?
Kwabena doesn't want Abena to get too excited.
We used to talk about our future.
I like fresh air.
What are you suggesting?
Even when I sat in the sun, I was cold.
Please air the room.
It hasn't been easy for Kwabena to earn enough money to support his large family.
Have him come.
Did you forget?
Is that so hard to do?
He likes playing soccer.
What didn't I write?
I made some corrections.
She knows the truth.
Do you really want to be here?
I need your cooperation.
The game was very interesting.
What has he done?
You may speak.
I telephoned her at once.
Thank you for your honesty.
I wonder if Kwabena has ever considered cycling to work.
Don't talk to me that way.
That cake looks good too. Give me a small piece.
We'd better get ready early because the train won't wait.
He can't have told a lie.
Is it about ten o'clock?
You must leave immediately.
I know that she is cute.
He's just an ordinary student.
He's an old timer.
He was not a good politician.
Nobody in the world wants war.
None of the boys paid any attention to Abena.
He is now in a very difficult situation.
Kwabena didn't know what Abena told John.
The weather was getting worse and worse.
You have nothing to fear anymore.
She's much heavier than him.
No sooner had she entered her room than she began to cry.
Kwabena is someone who can't be trusted.
Kwabena bought a bunch of grapes and I ate them.
We should confirm his intentions once more.
Oh, by the way, I have something to tell you.
My mother made me a sweater.
We want to help Kwabena.
Why is she so silent?
Were there any stars in the sky?
You don't have to eat it if you don't want to.
It was getting dark.
We're here to play golf.
I have to solve this problem.
They, too, were out of money.
I am convinced that I am right.
Leave tomorrow.
Kwabena is the last person in line.
That automobile was going very fast.
I offered to lend money to her.
I usually go to sleep very early.
It took her all afternoon to finish the work.
I informed her of my arrival.
Who else came to the party?
He is incapable of telling a lie.
I wonder if he's at home.
The doctor is not available now.
It's fun to visit old friends.
I'm afraid of spiders.
We are disturbing him.
I still make mistakes.
Nobody knows what to say.
Kwabena asked if there were any other options.
It is impossible for me to answer the question.
As soon as she opened the door, a cat ran out.
Berlin is the capital of Germany.
I've heard about you.
That will never disappear.
I can do this all day.
A great many people attended his funeral.
Kwabena didn't know that Abena was in love with him.
Do you have school today?
You don't know how worried I am.
We're the only people here.
Is there anything I can do to help?
Kwabena can stay here as long as he likes.
China is twenty times bigger than Japan.
What if they're wrong?
Everyone thinks Kwabena married Abena for her money.
He is kind.
When do you put up your Christmas tree?
He is adept at telling lies.
Kwabena has a bright career as a medical doctor.
You should keep your valuables in a safe place.
It's wonderful to be here.
I'm glad that I didn't eat the same thing that you did.
We'll talk with Kwabena on Monday.
Kwabena asked Abena why she was late.
Kwabena has never been to Boston.
Has he written the letter yet?
The medicine decreased his pain.
The ceremony was impressive.
It's not enough to know only one language.
Kwabena told Abena not to study so hard.
It could be a coincidence.
She lives in the same house her grandparents lived in.
I have seen him many times.
Kwabena, I want to stay with you.
Kwabena is their leader.
I wish you were a little more like me.
I gave in to her demands.
I thought you weren't going to do this again.
Kwabena had a good idea.
Who's taking responsibility for this?
I want time instead of money.
I need to know more about Kwabena.
Is Boston a big city?
I will help you all I can.
Kwabena and Abena are there with John now.
It's the little things in life that mean the most.
Do you want Kwabena to wait?
I'll do more than that.
Kwabena reminded Abena of John.
I need to go get some money out of the bank.
I haven't said anything.
I know that you are busy.
You're turning red.
It was tough to finish the work.
We go to church together.
I don't know anything about physics.
I'm not going to talk to you anymore.
He regretted not having taken my advice.
Kwabena carried everything he owned in a small suitcase.
Kwabena is the type of person who always has to have his own way.
I have a problem.
His story was interesting.
Her life is in danger.
Kwabena might not know the answer.
Kwabena works in a bank.
I am thankful for technology.
Kwabena said he hated this book.
All the leaves on the tree have turned yellow.
I don't remember doing that.
Kwabena went to buy another pair of shoes.
The city can be reached in less than 20 minutes by car from here.
She thinks about him when she's feeling lonely.
Do you eat out often?
I forgot to pay the rent.
One out of three people in this city owns a car.
Kwabena can't understand why Abena got so angry.
It's obviously a lie.
Why is Kwabena still in Boston?
Kwabena didn't mean to shoot anyone.
Do you know where the police station is?
Do you like dancing?
She devoted her life to education.
Asamoah picked up something off the table.
I thought Asamoah and Abena would have forgotten me by now.
Don't take it seriously.
I can see a ship in the distance.
Keep track of everything that looks promising.
Asamoah has a whole pile of unpaid parking tickets.
I want every day to be as good as this one.
Please choose wisely.
I couldn't stop.
We're fixing it up.
The food isn't very good here.
He wants to live as long as he can.
I must wait here.
He tried to learn French.
I'll turn it into a house.
There were a hundred people in the hall.
I don't want Asamoah telling me how to run my business.
The water in the lake is cool.
This is only for you.
I can't stand it.
It's a quote from a book.
I always try to obey the rules.
A crowd gathered around.
London, the capital of England, is on the Thames.
Degas was born more than 150 years ago.
I thought you didn't want to talk to us.
The teacher was worried by Asamoah's frequent absence from class.
The man put the gun against his forehead and squeezed the trigger.
I want to be a better person.
I was too surprised to speak.
Where are you hiding?
She is always at the bottom of the class.
This house needs painting.
Asamoah said he wanted me to spend the summer in Boston with him.
Old people need someone to talk to.
The instant he came in, he fell down.
A fat white cat sat on a wall and watched the two of them with sleepy eyes.
Please refrain from smoking.
You're very clean.
Did you get what you wanted?
There's no time to waste.
I can't recall her name at the moment.
My answer is yes.
Be attentive.
She took care of my dog.
Asamoah shot Abena with a shotgun.
I have no money with me now.
Please don't allow the children to play with knives.
Asamoah comes here every day.
He doesn't care about anything.
Where's your watch?
Asamoah found something hidden behind the dresser.
At present, we have 1,600 students at our school.
I like the way you sing.
She scolded him.
I just want to wait for a few more minutes.
Our lives are determined by our environment.
Asamoah doesn't want to do his homework right now.
I met my teacher on the street the other day.
Where do you want to sit?
I worry about him.
The lecture was really boring.
That was a lousy trick.
He had a strong alibi.
Can we have a moment alone?
That's not going to happen.
There used to be a small castle on this hill.
No one I know wears a tie anymore.
The river is five feet deep.
I don't know your real name.
You may need a shovel.
Who needs that old furniture?
The ambassador returned.
Who wants to party?
Everyone knows Asamoah is lying.
This is all Asamoah has to do.
Many children die of starvation in Africa.
We have a big dog.
We made inquiries into his past.
I wish I had been with you then.
I water the flowers in the garden every day.
I like to invent useful things.
The baby was in a deep sleep in his mother's arms.
He is poor, but honest.
Asamoah tried to cut down on his expenses.
Sit down and shut up.
Close the window before going to sleep.
Give me five gallons of gas, please.
The game is over.
He'll go, too, won't he?
Where did you find your key?
There's no difference.
We are looking for each other.
I don't know what to do tomorrow.
Please give me a little more chocolate.
That's a blue house.
The audience looked bored.
She has buried her only son.
He cried out.
Take the keys to your brother.
My wife made me a delicious apple cake.
Do you know her father?
Is there something you want?
Your joke is funny no matter how many times I hear it.
I want to explain.
Why didn't you call us?
I live near the dike.
You're helpful.
I love my friends.
What did you say your name was?
Can you take me to this address?
I often played baseball when I was young.
Asamoah and I want you to come with us.
Why did Asamoah leave you?
He dug a hole in the garden.
Don't use all the hot water.
He lives in a world of fantasy.
The net is huge.
I met your father yesterday.
Asamoah never said anything.
My life was in danger.
I want you to follow Asamoah.
I wouldn't say that.
That's over.
Why aren't you home?
I drive a black car.
She died in 1960.
You should fulfill your promises.
She had nothing to do with the case.
Please show me your injured arm.
I'll eat my hat if, by some chance, my team loses to yours.
I need a better job.
You should have come earlier.
Listen to your wife, Asamoah.
They're professional singers.
She asked him if he was happy.
She always smiles at me.
I don't know him at all.
Even though he was poor, he was happy.
He had his car stolen in that parking lot.
And he let the two men sleep at his home.
First of all, I will read this.
It was such a hard test that we did not have time to finish.
Asamoah asked me if I would be willing to help.
His name is familiar to us.
Pizza is my favorite food.
How can I solve this problem?
What are they saying?
At what hour was she born?
Soccer is the most popular in Brazil.
If he doesn't accept the job, somebody else will.
How many times do I have to tell you not to eat candy just before dinner?
When did you start learning German?
Now, it's your turn.
Asamoah has a lot of friends in Boston.
This ain't normal.
I couldn't sleep.
Are you saying you don't know?
Your help will save us a lot of work.
I don't want to waste your time.
I got up at six-thirty this morning.
We climbed the steep slope.
I've been very patient with you.
That's the most beautiful gift I've ever received.
I think you haven't understood the question.
We are so busy we'd take any help we could get.
This is immoral.
I'm too busy to help you do that.
I don't want to hear any complaints.
Asamoah had a lot of fun.
I think he takes after his father.
He went for the doctor.
It'll rain soon.
No one's been hurt.
They wouldn't give me a refund.
Asamoah eats more ice cream than I do.
Asamoah attached the string to the kite.
It must be pretty cold.
The roof leaks every time it rains.
He lived a lonely life in the forest.
The group was made up of four young men.
I spent the whole afternoon chatting with friends.
I got a call from her this morning.
I'm thinking of the plan.
What exactly is it you want us to do?
In Japan, the new school year begins in April.
He will probably fail.
I didn't give anything to Asamoah.
I hope we get some rain soon.
I can't tell you how much your support means to us.
They're trying.
Asamoah vanished.
Asamoah and Abena spend a lot of time together.
We've had a lot of rain this month.
It's an excellent wine.
That pair of pliers came in handy.
There are two zeros in the number "2010."
Boston is beautiful.
I didn't know you could cook this well, Asamoah.
I'll never forget your kindness.
I did not sleep well last night.
I am more than grateful to you for your help.
If you want my help, you'll have to ask for it.
I kept it with me.
Asamoah is my fiancé.
They have no idea what our problems are.
Keep dancing.
Asamoah sleeps in the nude in the summer.
They give presents to one another.
She makes him do his homework before dinner.
Has Flight 123 arrived?
Don't count on him to lend you any money.
He held her tightly.
Your daughter is very pretty.
I have to take a bus to go anywhere.
I've finally got used to urban life.
That man is dead.
I hope he'll be able to come! I'd like to see him.
You all just lost the game.
Do you know how to use a computer?
Find out what Asamoah wants.
I'm a liar.
He is a great swimming champion.
See what the problem is, OK?
He looked around the waiting room.
You can't miss it.
Weren't you crying?
I'm the best.
My father helped me with my homework.
Asamoah hesitated for a moment before answering Abena.
Asamoah began to wonder who Abena had learned French from.
I once worked in a restaurant.
Money doesn't grow on trees.
Who wants cookies?
They never spoke to us.
I hope you like the job.
We do need your advice.
Nobody heard Asamoah's screams.
When's the wedding?
Asamoah is the captain of this baseball team.
You should prepare for the worst.
It wasn't really a very good plan.
Asamoah has a lot of good ideas.
You can get there in less than thirty minutes.
The writer has an excellent style.
Are you a believer?
Why do I have to talk to Asamoah?
I'm sick of eating out every night.
Learning a musical instrument trains the mind.
My son always gets sick when he rides a bus.
I have never seen a red refrigerator.
It's very simple.
Where's your backpack?
I am like my brother.
They met in high school.
We had a very good time at the dinner.
I've waited two whole hours. I can't wait any longer.
Keep looking.
They were badly injured in a car accident.
I'm willing to share.
We want a car.
I like to draw pictures.
Asamoah spent the night in jail.
Few things give us as much pleasure as music.
I'm going to France to study painting.
He earns over 500 dollars a month at that job.
She was brought up in the lap of luxury.
Asamoah needed the money.
Asamoah gave it to Abena.
She slapped his face.
I like to give gifts to my family and friends.
There is no other way.
Cloning people raises serious ethical problems.
Do you like this drawing?
Asamoah has sold his house in Boston.
Could you hand me the newspaper on the table?
There are forty students in our class.
He has all kinds of books.
This custom is peculiar to Japan.
How long have you waited?
Deal us the cards.
Don't just read books. Go outside once in a while and get some exercise.
Take your dog away.
He came to ask us to help him.
You look great.
All's fair in love and war.
Asamoah refuses to work.
Asamoah made Abena angry.
Asamoah asked me what I had bought.
My dad bought me books.
Don't give up halfway.
Call the fire department!
Always obey your father.
You're not funny.
Everybody hates Asamoah.
What are you thinking about?
I'm kind of happy.
No thank you, I'm full.
Please tell me about you and your family.
Someone told me Abena left her husband.
She was educated in the United States.
His mother was ashamed of him.
I can't give up smoking.
Yesterday, as I was walking along the street, I saw an accident.
Nobody wanted to believe Asamoah.
Is a meal served on this flight?
Asamoah and Abena exchange more than 200 text messages every day.
I saw him being scolded by his father.
Don't worry about it!
Please lower the flag.
I don't remember anything.
Dogs are man's best friends.
How did you enjoy the concert?
They all did it.
Did you read that thick book?
Asamoah can't be that naive.
His daughter has become a pretty woman.
I wish I could sing like you do.
Do you have a tattoo?
I'm closing my store.
He is afraid to fly in an airplane.
I say it's worth a try.
I play tennis, but my form is terrible.
I am mopping my room.
This makes me mad.
You're just jealous.
We took turns in washing the car.
He heard a shout.
He left Japan never to come back.
Asamoah is romantic.
Did they repair the watch?
I won't make you do anything you don't want to.
This mountain is covered with snow all year round.
What a heavy bag!
No one can deny the fact that fire burns.
My father is a doctor.
Someday your dream will come true.
This car is mine.
My dream is to take a round-the-world trip.
The vacation is close to an end.
Many Americans blamed Spain.
The girl screamed when she saw the flames.
That's what I want.
That would be cool.
I'll do so immediately.
I'm taking a walk in a park.
English is spoken in many parts of the world.
Do you have a garage?
I think Asamoah is pretty angry.
Asamoah didn't feel anything.
We know that Asamoah is here.
He is working hard in order to pass the entrance examination.
It was nothing but a coincidence.
There is nothing as important as friendship.
Only you answered the question.
Asamoah had a problem with his car.
When do you return home?
I don't know his address.
Where does this book go?
I never imagined anything like this.
Asamoah abandoned Abena.
You are sure to succeed in time.
Is there space for another person?
We are leaving Narita next Monday.
He doesn't know who built those houses.
He could not go out because of the heavy rain.
It's only the beginning.
Let me come over.
Holmes went out of the room without being noticed by anyone.
Asamoah helped Abena carry her suitcases.
Asamoah doesn't like to be disturbed.
Asamoah walks about fifteen miles a day.
That was the tiniest cockroach I've ever seen in my life.
Asamoah says he can speak a little French.
Asamoah's parents are older than mine.
I have a pain in my chest.
Asamoah didn't really enjoy studying French.
An automobile ran over him.
If it had not been for your raincoat, I would have been drenched to the skin.
It's very relaxing.
More than 3,000 people were at the concert.
It is difficult to overcome this shortcoming without drastically changing the whole system.
They are very proud of being students of that college.
I lost my shoe in the fire.
I still have some feelings for her.
Your ticket, please.
I just need some aspirin.
Asamoah needed someone to help him.
He has gone abroad by himself.
I will make him pay the money.
Asamoah was detained as a suspect.
The man hit me on the head.
A solution had to be found.
It's not at all rare to live to be over ninety years old.
I'm glad that you'll come.
I don't trust businessmen.
This is an example of the survival of the fittest, as it is called.
It was the most boring trip of my entire life.
He was visiting his foster mother.
Asamoah had a great time.
I would like you to assist me with my gardening.
I can play tennis.
Do you want to go on a picnic with me?
Your father is tall.
Asamoah is in danger of failing this class.
I'm afraid of heights.
I think you went too far.
It looks fun. Why don't we try it?
I only want what's best for everyone.
I'm not a magician.
Asamoah has a cow.
I'm not narrow-minded.
I don't think you're heartless.
It must've rained during the night.
Asamoah is extremely forgetful.
Now you've come of age, you have the right to vote.
There are a lot of breweries in Bavaria.
Your French is improving.
I'll see you Monday.
She is busy preparing supper now.
What is the acreage of your ranch?
Asamoah wondered when Abena had bought the milk that was in the refrigerator.
We must make do with what we have got.
Asamoah cut his hand with a rusty knife.
How do I look?
What Asamoah did wasn't illegal.
Thoughts are expressed by means of words.
I didn't tell him everything.
The place where he lives is far from town.
You don't understand.
In any case, it's none of your business.
Asamoah felt guilty.
The Alps are in the center of Europe.
This should be easy.
I thought I knew him, but I didn't.
He doesn't study as hard as he used to.
We have less than an hour.
Do you have any idea why Asamoah disappeared?
I'm going to need some volunteers.
Did you receive the letter?
I'll always remember you.
Who ate?
Find Asamoah.
Asamoah doesn't like people touching his stuff.
When did you see my scar?
Don't speak.
I thought it was cute.
I'm in a hurry.
How was today's test?
He was forced to return to Washington.
I fell asleep while reading.
You weren't even there.
Let Asamoah know where I am.
It isn't raining much this year.
The room has a seating capacity of 200.
Where shall I wait for you?
Have you ever been to Kyoto?
Asamoah played with his kids.
He was unconscious for three days.
Asamoah was ostracized.
You can read this book.
Even smart people are sometimes absent-minded.
Asamoah was laughing at Abena.
You may call me anytime.
How much is the bus fare?
Would you like to go to a movie tomorrow night?
He's a cold-hearted jerk.
Asamoah is a firefighter.
Asamoah wants to know when you're coming home.
She was painfully skinny.
It won't be long before they get married.
It's exciting.
I've done nothing.
Asamoah didn't think you would like the idea.
You must beware of strange dogs.
She loves cats.
They didn't mistreat me.
That's okay.
This place has everything.
Asamoah pulled into his garage, turned off the engine, and then got out of the car.
I want you to tell me the truth.
My father grows rice.
There were many children in the room.
I owe you a lunch.
I did what I could.
Asamoah's busy.
There is nothing like air travel.
Where's the book I need?
She likes cooking for her family.
I'll never listen to Asamoah again.
I hate rats.
She wants me to go with her.
China is an emerging market.
I miss Boston.
I searched all over for Asamoah.
Asamoah hates it when it's cold.
She bowed to me politely.
I studied French when I was in high school.
Do you think anyone will be able to overhear what we're talking about?

His father always comes home late.

You're too tall.
You're too tall.
She is trying to lose weight.
Have you been told when to come?
I have a week to do my homework.
All these devices are unreliable.
Kwaku didn't look happy to see me.
They just want an excuse to fire you.
Frankly speaking, I don't agree with you.
Kwaku eats like a pig.
He is a man of noble birth.
You aren't allowed to go into that room.
Kwaku said that he was feeling tired.
Kwaku and Abena bought a house in Boston last year.
The scar on his cheek hardly shows now.
She stood on her head.
They're coming for us.

The newspaper said that a typhoon was approaching.
I want to see Kwaku now.
Kwaku will be here on Monday.

Tell her that I know who she is.

You have a message.
Did you remember to turn off the gas?
It has some bearing on this problem.
Kwabena has many powerful friends.

Kofi often helps me with my homework.
I prefer working alone.
It wasn't Kofi who lit the campfire.
I'm trying to help you become a better person.

We've got less than three minutes.
I don't think Kofi likes it.
Kofi goes to Boston every once in a while.
Dozens of letters are awaiting you.

The pain is getting worse.

I'm in the attic.
The air is damp.

Haven't you returned those books yet?
Ama died from a drug overdose.
I read a lot.
Please call an ambulance.
Ama is productive.
We're taking off.
How young do you think Ama is?
Ama has been playing the violin for more than thirty years.
Not everyone is happy about this.
The sun is sinking below the horizon.
They captured Ama.
He has many acquaintances but few friends.
I'd leave.
That's the least of your problems.
Her sister lives in Scotland.
What they did was wrong.
Maybe I should have spoken with Ama.

Abena lost most of his belongings in the fire.
You're one of the people in this picture.
They had to start from scratch.
They had to start from scratch.
We overlooked Abena's name when we sent out invitations.
Abena promised to come home early tonight.
Did you want to see me?
Don't say it in a roundabout way.
Better a live coward than a dead hero.
He stood up and took a deep breath.
I have 1,500 herd of cattle.
I bet Abena was surprised.
It's my turn to wash the dishes.

We should be fine.
Kwame and Adwoa were good friends.
What's it going to take to persuade you?
Say it in French.
Kwame, this is my cousin.
They set the time and place of the wedding.
Someone rang the doorbell.
Everyone knew that.
Why do you keep giving him money?
Kwame's clothes are out of fashion.
It all makes sense now.
They got married on Christmas Eve.
I thought you'd stopped dating Kwame.
She has a habit of biting her nails.
Kwame would never hurt you.
The baby started to cry.
Kwame was lying on the bed.
Go with these men.
A fish leaped out of the water.
I spent 3,000 yen on a new CD.
Kwame is coming over this evening.
Did you ever hear the like of it?
Adwoa and Pokua value their privacy.
I remember seeing him once.
We came to the conclusion that we should support the movement.
There are large houses along the street.
He has a Picasso.
Pokua is still looking for Adwoa.
Pokua looked toward Adwoa.
She lives in Yokohama.
Choose between these two.
That isn't a good reason.
Pokua must consider carefully whether he really wants a divorce or not.
We want our money back.
Is everything you own in that chest?
In the future, try to get to the office on time.
Pokua didn't mean to offend Adwoa.
I'm afraid it's not going to be that easy.
This knife is dull.
May I have the check, please?
Pokua did it very carefully.
Pokua is going to survive.
Pokua is getting married Pokuaorrow.
Yaw said he was too tired to dance.

I don't expect you to reply.
Where's your key?
We stayed at a cheap hotel.
Could you bring me a blanket?
Yaw can barely breathe.
I want those back when you're done.
Yaw is merely stating the obvious.
I don't know what happened to Yaw.
We went to the museum.
Do you want to look into it?
I'm not taking any chances.
Tell Yaw to wait a moment.
You can't do this.

I think what you need now is to eat something.
She died at the age of 54.
We can handle that.
My head still hurts.
I'm in the same boat.
Yaw showed her the letter from Santa Claus.
We're pretty proud of ourselves.
It was pure chaos.
He is known to all the people in the town.
I didn't ask Yaw to go there.
Yaw is an evil man.
Jealousy was the motive for the murder.
The plants must have died because no one watered them.
Yaw doesn't even remember what happened last night.
I'm sorry to have kept you waiting so long.
This coat fits you.
Yaw is clueless.
He was listening to the music in his room.
Please tell me where the bus stop is.
Here is the book you are looking for.
I didn't want to go, but I needed to.
There is no furniture left in the room.
Yaw will be back tomorrow.
These books are worth reading at least once.
I'll go out after having dinner.
How long's Yaw been sick?
Open your book to page 59.
I'm sorry I'm late.
I'd like to know your opinion.
That's enough for today. I'm tired.

What Yaw said is right.
Yaw has perfect teeth.

I always have eggs for breakfast.
I doubt Yaw is really a doctor.

It's too early to leave.
Yaw earns three times more than me.
I don't like traveling by air.
There was something I needed to get at the supermarket, but I forgot to pick it up.
I wonder why she is so worried.

Who asked you?
Yaw lay awake almost all night thinking about Adwoa.
You're just wasting your time.
